								<h3>OVERALL ANALYSIS</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Smokestack Lightnin' by Howlin' Wolf</i> is a one-chord blues vamp (an arrangement that is played over and over again) first recorded in 1956. <i>Smokestack Lightnin'</i> 
									tells a story about a woman who keeps coming and going, and plays with the imagery of a train to act as a double-meaning; where the woman comes and goes like how a train would.
								</p>
								<p>
									This song utilizes heavy reference relating the woes of the singer's woman leaving with that of a train coming and going, and this is only exacerbated by both the musical and rhythmical choices used in this song.
									What is immediately clear from listening to the song is the use of the syncopated snare drum on the backbeat to create the sound of a train chugging, putting emphasis on the train imagery. In addition to this, 
									the naming of the song <i>"Smokestack Lightnin'"</i> refers to the stack of smoke that can be seen on old locomotive engines from the 50's. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The song's use of a strophic form (where the same music is repeated from verse to verse, but the lyrics are changed) hits home the reptetive feeling of a train chugging along, and further 
									sends home the message of the woman's coming and going to an almost monotonous feel.

												<th>Form Section</th>

												<th>Description</th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Intro</td>
												<td>00:00 - 00:10</td>
												<td>&#127900;Instrumental&#127900;</td>
												<td>The song begins with an electric guitar into leading into a syncopated snare drum, mimicking the mechanical noises of a train.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>First Verse</td>
												<td>00:11 - 00:36</td>
												<td>Ah-oh, smokestack lightnin'
													Shinin' just like gold
													Why don't ya hear me cryin'?
													A-whoo-hooo, oooo
													Whooo</td>
												<td>The first verse begins with a few lines of lyrics, followed by an almost whining <i>"A-whoo-hooo, oooo</i> like phrase. This not only mimicks the whine of a train whistle, 
												but also represents the singer's lamentation over his sorrows.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Second Verse</td>
												<td>00:37 - 01:08</td>
												<td>Whoa-oh, tell me baby
													What's the matter with you?
													Why don't ya hear me cryin'?
													Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo
													Whooo</td>
												<td>The second verse follows the form of the first verse; with lines of lyrics followed by the song's signature whining. Each verse is separated by a short instrumental, 
													perhaps signifying the time in between the train's coming and going.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Third Verse</td>
												<td>01:09 - 01:34</td>
												<td>Whoa-oh, tell me baby
													Why did ya stay last night?
													A-why don't ya hear me cryin'?
													Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo
													Whooo</td>
												<td>
													Yet again, the third verse follows form.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Fourth Verse</td>
												<td>01:35 - 02:04</td>
												<td>Whoa-oh, stop your train
													Let a poor boy ride
													Why don't ya hear me cryin'?
													Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo
													Whooo</td>
												<td>
													The fourth verse continues the form set in the previous verses.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Fifth Verse</td>
												<td>02:05 - 02:30</td>
												<td>Whoa-oh, fare ya well
													Never see a you no more
													A-why don't ya hear me cryin'?
													Oooo, whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo
													Whooo</td>
												<td>The fourth and fifth verse are segmented by a harmonica solo. Its addition is a reprieve from the repetition of the first two verses both musically and rhythmically. 
													The tone and timbre of the harmonica adds a unique layer of texture to the song, and the vibrato within the solo mimicks a sort of crying or wavering.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sixth Verse</td>
												<td>02:31 - 3:08</td>
												<td>Whoa-oh, who been here baby since
													I-I been gone, a little, bitty boy?
													Girl, be on
													A-whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo</td>
												<td>
													A fading out harmonica solo is present near the end of the song. This perhaps represents a fading of hope that the singer's woman will return. It also adds a nice finishing touch to the 
													song and resolves a hard and brash beat and chord progression.
												</td>

									<h3>INSTRUMENTS</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Drums: </b> The drums in this song are used with syncopation on beats 2 and 4. The drums are essential in setting the pace and the feel of the song. The drums are key in tying together the train 
										references along with the true meaning of the song (as discussed in the overall analysis.
										</li>
										<li> <b>Male Singer: </b><i>Howlin' Wolf's</i> signature croon is integral to selling the wounded man's sorrows that is everpresent in this song. The huskiness in his voice adds a timbre that would make 
											this song lacking without it.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Harmonica: </b>The harmonica adds a layer of texture to an otherwise repetetive song, and is a metaphor for crying in my opinion.
										</li>
										<li><b>Electric Guitar: </b>The electric guitar plays the bulk of the blues E minor chord progression. 
										</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<div id="meterandtempo">
									<h3>Meter and Tempo</h3>
									<p>
										The song is in duple meter, and the tempo is at a moderate 145 beats per minute. It mimicks a train chugging by with great efficacy. This meter is hit home by the use of strong 
										syncopated drumbeats.

						<!-- CREATIVE ASSIGNMENT -->
							<article id="unit2">
								<h2 class="major">Creative Assignment - CONCERT HOME REPORT</h2>
								<h2>Comparison of two Tom Misch Concerts</h2>
								<p>I wanted to do a comparison of two different concerts by <i>Tom Misch</i>. 
								One in a more private setting, and one on the big stage in front of a massive 
								crowd. In this creative assignment, I will be doing a side by side analysis 
								of the two concerts in terms of <i>Tom Misch's</i> performance style and non-musical elements, 
								as well as an in-depth comparison of one of the songs that shows up on both sets.</p>
								<h3>Overall analysis</h3>
								<p>What is immediately noticeable is <i>Tom Misch's</i> compositional style. <i>Tom Misch's</i> music often encompasses groovy beats alongside a 
									heavy influence from J Dilla's production style, to D Angelo's Neo-Soul chord progressions. This results in musically complex songs that are somehow 
									easy to listen to for audiences that are not well versed in Jazz. What I found interesting, though, is how <i>Tom Misch</i> adapts his music 
									between intimate settings and on the big stage. What I like about <i>Tom Misch</i> 
									is his choice of style. During both performances, his choice of clothing maintains the same, along with the general vibe of his performance. <i>Tom Misch</i> somehow 
									manages to evoke a sense of the big stage and intimacy in equal measures regardless of setting. <br><br>What I did notice, muscially, was the heavier 
									use of drums and percussion in the big stage performance. His performances on the big stage utilize a greater percussive element to shift the atmosphere from a more chill 
									and intimate atmosphere to one more evoking of a party or a big performance. This also lends into him utilizng the percussive beat to get some audience participation (as seen 
									when he asks the audience to clap their hands along to the beat at 19:12 in the Montreux Jazz Festival performance). Upon listening to the two concerts (you can listen to them 
									yourself in the youtube panels below) there are not many musical differences or performance differences between the two. A difference I did note was the use of improvisation 
									and solos utilizing the Dorian Scale in his big stage performances. The additional time allows him to really flex his mastery of the guitar. </p>

										<h3>Tom Misch - Tiny Desk Concert</h3>
										<p><i>Starts at 10:44</i></p>
										<p>10:44 - The Tiny Desk Concert version begins with a brief solo from <i>Tom Misch</i> which is not present in the studio recording. Here, he plays the main chord progression 
											of the song accompanied by a light drum beat. This evokes a very light and intimate feel to the song. Additionally, this intro provides a more personal feeling to the song 
											as the introduction is improvised and is a departure from the monologue heard in the studio recording.</p>
										<p>11:50 - The first verse begins, not much is different between the two version of the song.</p>
										<p>12:38 - The second guitar and the rest of the instruments begin to play, this version of the song is much more lighter in terms of texture, as well as having a much more 
											personal feel to it.
										</p>
										<p>15:00 - The piano solo begins, which is similar to the studio recording version.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="flex-container2">
										<h3>Tom Misch - Live at Montreux Jazz Festival</h3>
										<p><i>Starts at 26:22</i></p>
										<p>26:22 - The Montreux Jazz Festival version begins with the monologue by Polly Misch as heard in the studio recording, this monologue is backed by a light chord progression. 
											What is different about this rendition of <i>Movie</i> is that it is definitely a more "true" rendition of the song as compared to the studio version.
										</p>
										<p>27:19 - The first verse begins, not much is different between the two version of the song.</p>
										<p>28:08 - The second guitar and the rest of the instruments begin to play, this is a much more full rendition of the song (in terms of timbre) with the number of instruments 
											adding a level of texture to the song not present in the Tiny Desk Concert. The use of xylophones and other percussion add additional flair to the song.
										</p>
										<p>30:30 - Here, the pianist begins an improvised solo. This is a departure from the studio version of the song, and has a much jazzier feel to it than the piano solo in the 
											Tiny Desk Concert.
